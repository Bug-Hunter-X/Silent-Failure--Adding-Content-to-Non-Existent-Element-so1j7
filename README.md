# Silent Failure: Adding Content to a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where attempting to add content to a non-existent element results in a silent failure. The code runs without throwing any errors, but the intended effect (adding the text) is not achieved.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in the JavaScript code that attempts to access and modify the `innerHTML` property of an element with the ID `nonExistentElement`.  Since this element is not present in the HTML, the operation fails silently. This is different from cases where a simple typo would throw an error.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling or making sure the element exists before attempting to add the content.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `bug.html` file in your web browser.
3. Observe that the text "This text is not visible." does not appear.

## How to Fix
1. Use `document.getElementById` to check if the element exists first, or use a more robust way to add content.
2.  Inspect the `solution.html` file for an example of adding content to an element only if the element exists.
